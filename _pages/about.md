Glad that you are here! My name is Yan Wu, and I'm currently a junior at MIT studying math and computer science. I've spent the first fourteen years in Tianjin, China. After that, I went to New Jersey for high school for four years. I speak Mandarin Chinese and English, and have been learning Japanese for more than a year.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy cooking and video games. I also enjoy making and drinking coffee. My ultimate dream is to have a coffee corner once I have my own living space :)
